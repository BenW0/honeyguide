<h1>Honeyguide Usage Instructions</h1>

<p>Honeyguide is an application which inserts custom image stacks into a Creation Workshop CWS file. Why Honeyguide?
    See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeyguide">Honeyguide</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brood_parasite">Brood Parasite</a></p>

<p>You need three things to make this work:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>A "Template" CWS file</b>. This file is one you generated in CreationWorkshop that provides the settings and structure
        needed for Honeyguide to make a functioning CWS file for your system. See below for instructions on generating
        the template.</li>
    <li><b>A set of images</b>. This "stack" of images are the images which will be inserted into the CWS file, replacing those
        saved in the template file. The images must be in the same folder and sequentially numbered. Padding zeros are
        optional. To import, select the first image in the sequence in the dialog.</li>
    <li><b>An output filename</b>. After Honeyguide runs, the name of the output file cannot be changed, or CreationWorkshop
        fails to detect the embedded images.</li>
</ol>

<p>After running Honeyguide, import your new CWS file into CreationWorkshop using File -> Open (you may need to select
CreationWorkshop Scene Files from the list of file types). Generally, your images are visible in the Slice View pane.</p>

<h3>Generating a Template CWS</h3>
<p>To generate a template CWS file for use in Honeyguide, following these instructions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open CreationWorkshop. Import and position a dummy STL which is at
    least as tall as your image stack. This object will not appear in your final print.</li>
    <li>Check CreationWorkshop's slicing settings, machine settings, and display resolution. These settings will
        be baked into the template CWS and all derived CWS files and cannot be changed afterwards.</li>
    <li>In addition to your specific settings, make sure that your selected slicing profile has "Export Images & GCode"
        checked</li>
    <li>Slice your scene using the Cake button and your chosen slicing profile</li>
    <li>Go to File -> Save As to save your new template CWS.</li>

</ol>
<p>Once generated, the same Template can be used for multiple runs of Honeyguide.</p>

<h3>Advanced Options</h3>
Clicking the Show Options button brings up some additional configuration options for the honeyguide algorithm.
<ul>
    <li><b>Image Mask</b> causes a mask image to be multiplied by the image to be displayed on the projector. This can
        be used to correct for irregularities in projection brightness. In the mask image, a white pixel represents
        "no change" to the source image, gray pixels darken the source image, and a black pixel forces the output image
        to black at that point.</li>
    <li><b>Negate Input Images</b> inverts the pixel value of the image prior to compositing. This is useful if your
        image source has a white background and black object. Default: Unchecked.</li>
    <li><b>Threshold</b> performs a "threshold" operation on the image before compositing. This means all pixels above
        a certain intensity (given in <b>Threshold Level</b>) are painted white, and all others are black, effectively
        removing all shades of gray. Default: Unchecked</li>
    <li><b>Just Replicate First Image</b> causes the code to re-use the image selected in the top dialog for every layer,
        producing an output CWS containing the same frame repeated over and over again, for as many layers as the template
        CWS contains. Default: Unchecked</li>
    <li><b>ImageMagick Install Folder</b> is needed on some systems where ImageMagick is not in your PATH environment
        variable or where other tools have the same name (specifically "convert.exe" on Windows). If errors occur during
        processing, try setting this field to the folder ImageMagick was installed to. Default: Empty</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Notes</h3>
<p>Honeyguide never re-scales the images you provide. They are placed, centered, on a black canvas that matches the resolution
of your projector screen (as recorded in the Template CWS). If they are larger than your projector screen, they will be
cropped. If they are smaller, they are padded with black to match the resolution of the projector.</p>

<p>If you use a Honeyguide-generated CWS file on a projector which is at a different resolution than that used
when generating the template CWS file, images may appear warped or off-center, due to the way CreationWorkshop
handles pre-generates slices.</p>

<p>Additional Information: CWS files are simply Zip archives which can contain the image slices,
STL model, GCode, and some additional metadata. Honeyguide replaces just the images in the template CWS, leaving
everything else alone, and zips the result back into a new CWS. CWS files do not have to include image slices,
however; hence the importance of checking "Export Images and GCode" in the steps given above.</p>

<p><b>Security Note:</b> This code uses a variety of <i>very</i> insecure Python commands. Don't dream of doing anything
secure with this program!</p>

<h3>Command Line Usage</h3>
<p><b>This is not implemented yet</b></p>
<p>To use Honeyguide from the command line, do the following:</p>
<code>python [path to Honeyguide]/main.py [template CWS] [first input image] [output CWS]</code>
<p>where</p>
<p><b><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[path to Honeyguide]</code></b> is the path to the location of the Honeyguide Python program</p>
<p><b><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[Template CWS]</code></b> is the template CWS file (escape with quotes if the path contains spaces)</p>
<p><b><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[first input image]</code></b> is the location of the first image in the set of images you want to insert.</p>
<p><b><code>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[output CWS]</code></b> is the location of the CWS file to export.</p>
All arguments are required.
